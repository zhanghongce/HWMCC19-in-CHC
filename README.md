### Translated HWMCC19 Benchmarks 

The original benchmark comes from the HWMCC19 website : http://fmv.jku.at/hwmcc19/

`btor2` contains the original benchmarks in two tracks `BV` and `ABV`.
`aig` is the `BV` track problems in AIGER format.
`chc` contains the CHC format.
`chcrel` is the rule dialect format supported by Z3.
`vmt` is the VMT format problem translated from CHC using the Horn2VMT tool comes with IC3ia: https://es-static.fbk.eu/people/griggio/ic3ia/index.html

I obtained permission from Armin Biere for creating derived works from the existing benchmarks and putting them public available. However, I do not know what exactly the license is, so please consult HWMCC19's organizors if you have questions about the license. Thanks!
